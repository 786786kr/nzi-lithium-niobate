# Welcome in the NZI Material Finder!
This tool leverages the MPB Python Interface, which is part of the MEEP repository, to perform simulations of 2D photonic crystals and photonic crystal slabs.
This tool has been developed to find NZI Material realized with of PhCs. 

It is possible to use the Dash application or directly write your code in Python using the API for further data analysis; for the latter I suggest using Jupyther Notebook. 

The basic process flow is: 

1. Choose the crystal type (2D or Slab)
2. Choose the lattice type (triangular or square)
3. Choose the materials of background, substrate,  bulk and atom
4. Choose the geometry of the atom (circular, square, elliptical or rectangular)
5. Set the MPB Solver
6. Run the simulatiom 
7. Plot the bands
8. Investigate the field at specific band points
9. If you want, you can sweep some geometry parameters.
